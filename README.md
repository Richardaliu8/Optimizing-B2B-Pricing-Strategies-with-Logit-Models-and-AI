Optimizing B2B Pricing Strategies with Logit Models and AI

Project Overview  
This project focuses on optimizing B2B pricing strategies by analyzing discounts and predicting revenue improvements using logit models. Leveraging AI for data preparation, model training, and optimization, we aim to identify effective discount strategies that enhance revenue.  

Features  
Data Preparation: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by converting date columns, creating binary variables, and splitting into training and hold-out samples.  
Logit Model Implementation: Developed and trained logit models to estimate the probability of winning deals based on discount amounts and other variables.  
Discount Optimization: Calculated optimal discounts for the hold-out sample and compared revenue improvements with unoptimized discounts.  
AI Integration: Utilized AI tools to guide data preparation, model training, and optimization processes, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.  
Performance Evaluation: Reported expected revenue improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of optimized discounts over unoptimized ones.  

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to optimize B2B pricing strategies by identifying the most effective discount amounts that maximize revenue. Using logit models and AI, we aim to provide insights into discount optimization, demonstrating the potential for significant revenue enhancement. The findings assist in refining pricing strategies and improving decision-making in B2B environments.
